# Data Scientist Techinical Coding Challenge (Round 3)
This repo holds everything that you will need to complete this techinical interview. 

You are encourages to think outloud and use google when nesseccary but please not copy and pasting code from stack overflow. 

The use of LLMs to generate code is **not** permitted.

## Format
This is a 1h30 interview and we expect each section to be broken down into:

 - Question 2 (NAME) 15 mins
 - Question 3 (NAME) 45 mins

Each question is located in the sub folders of this repo where you will find all the relevent information in the `readme.md`

## Prerequesits
 - `python 3.12` (other versions above 3.9 also fine) in a new virtual environment (made with venv, conda etc. doesn't matter)
 - `pip` for installing dependencies to the python virtual environment
 - `git` installed (command line tools preferred but using with IDE e.g. with VScode extension also fine)
 - any `IDE/Text editor` you are comfortable with (VScode, Cursor, atom, sublime, vim, emacs etc.) Any AI coding tools are not permitted

## Setup
Please install the required python packages inside the `requirements.txt` using pip
